This script---gridsite.inc---is meant to be housed outside normal server 
Document Roots (e.g. /var/www/etc/gridsite.inc on RedHat clone systems)
i.e. not within reach of any direct request to the web server and should 
be referenced by the relevant "auto_prepend_file" directive in php.ini 
along with setting the corresponding "include_path".
