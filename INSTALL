This script---gridsite.inc---is meant to be housed outside normal server 
Document Roots (e.g. /var/www/etc/gridsite.inc on RedHat clone or Ubuntu
systems) i.e. not within reach of any direct request to the web server
and should be referenced by the relevant "auto_prepend_file" directive
in php.ini along with setting the corresponding "include_path".

On Ubuntu 16.04 systems, for example, add the file gridsite.inc
to /var/www/etc/ add the file 99-gridsite.inc to /etc/php/7.0/apache2/conf.d/ 
assuming gridsite.inc is located as above.
